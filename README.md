# Graph-Cut-Images

NAME : SAI SRAGVI VIBHUSHAN NIDAMARTI

CAMPUS ID : gt73213@umbc.edu

**About the project**:

In this project we perform image quilting, by considering a small patch from a given image and use that to get an image of bigger size.
We achieve the results by implementing min-cut using the Edmond Karps and Ford Fulkerson Algorithms.

The code can be found in 'Project' notebook and relevant outputs can be found under each cell.

We choose the algorithm to work on by passing the name of the algo as a parameter to the replicateImage function as follows:

--For Edmond Algo ------
finalImage,overlapPlot = replicateImage(img, 25 , (6, 6),'todo',"Edmond",False,False)

--For Ford Algo--------------------- 
finalImage,overlapPlot = replicateImage(img, 25 , (6, 6),'todo',"Ford",True,True)

The last two variables define whether you need a sequence of outputs and the cut graphs respectivley.


**Imported libs and modules**

math
from skimage import io, util
heapq
sklearn

The following moules are not in-built and will be found as python files in the directory
_import Edmon
import Ford
from patchGeneration import_

**Note** : If any by any chance , you encounter a attribute not found error for the above three modules, please restart the jupyter kernel and run the import cells again

Installation commands :
 pip install matplotlib==3.5.0
 
 pip install numpy==1.21.4
 
 pip install opencv-python==4.5.5.64
 
 pip install Pillow==8.4.0

**How to Run the File**:
It is a Jupyter Notebook and can be run just by pressing the run button / ctrl+enter on each cell



**Results Intepreatation:**

The python Notebook consists two sections for the Edmon,Ford algorithms.

Here is the final image for a given input:

Intermediatary results :

1. Min Cut representation in the overlap region :

      The following image shows the vertical cut for one of the sequences.
      Here, the green region represents the portion of pixels that are to be taken from the left patch and the white portion represents the pixels that are to be taken from the right patch.
       The following image shows the horizontal cut for one of the sequences.
       Here, the green region represents the portion of pixels that are to be taken from the upper patch and the white portion represents the pixels that are to be taken from the lower patch.

2. Overlap region and the cut representaiton for the whole image
      The following image represents the overlap region's that were considered on a whole while in the process of constructing the resultant image.
      The red portion suggests that the pixels were considered from the left/up patch and the white portion suggests that the pixesl were considered from the right/bottom patch.

3. Sequential updates of the result image

**Adjancency Matrix** :

Adjancency matrices that were constructed for the formation of the resultant images are stored in the text files with names following the format:
   -> imageName+fileCounter+_Vertical+algoName

**Pixel Vectors**:

These values are represented as x-y , which indicates that there is a cut on the edge between x and y; Stored in text file under /Pixel Vectors directory
File Names are similar to the above represented format.
